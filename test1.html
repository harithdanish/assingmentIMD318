        <p style="line-height: 2.0; font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;">
            My name is Muhammad Harith Danish Bin Anuar. I am a confident, disciplined, and focused individual who believes in working smart and doing things with purpose. I always strive to give my best, whether in personal life or anything I get involved in. With a calm attitude and determined mindset, I aim to stand out and create something meaningful.

            I value growth and self-improvement. I enjoy learning new things, planning ahead, and staying organized. Cleanliness, professionalism, and respect are important to me, and I always try to be someone people can depend on without losing my true self.

            As the second son in my family, I’m driven to become the best version of myself. I want to make my family proud and build a future based on hard work and strong values. Quiet at times, I believe in letting my actions speak louder than words, and I aim to inspire and make a positive impact in everything I do.

        <h1>In My Own Time</h1>
        <p style="line-height: 2.0; font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;">
        I enjoy doing things that help me relax, stay creative, and keep my mind active. I often spend time exploring new ideas, watching videos that teach me something useful, or just enjoying peaceful moments to clear my thoughts. I also like organizing and planning things for the future, whether it's personal goals or small improvements in my daily routine. I’m the type of person who finds peace in being productive, even during rest.

        One of my favourite ways to unwind is spending time with my car. I'm not the type to go too deep into technical stuff all the time, but I enjoy learning and doing small upgrades to make it better and more enjoyable to drive. It's something that keeps me focused and gives me a sense of satisfaction. Whether it’s doing minor tuning or just taking a quiet drive, working on my car is more than just a hobby — it's a way for me to stay connected to something I love.

        Besides that, I also enjoy simple things like hanging out with close friends, listening to music, or just having time alone to recharge. I believe that balance is important, and having meaningful free time helps me stay mentally strong, creative, and ready for whatever comes next.

        The Mitsubishi Galant and Mitsubishi Eterna are closely related mid-size sedans that share many similarities in design, engineering, and performance. Both models were developed by Mitsubishi during the late 1980s and early 1990s, and they were built on the same platform, meaning they had identical chassis structures, dimensions, and suspension setups. This shared foundation made the two cars very similar in terms of overall driving dynamics, handling, and ride comfort.
        <br><br>
        In terms of exterior design, the Galant and Eterna featured nearly the same body shape and styling elements, such as the headlights, grille, and side profiles, with only minor cosmetic differences depending on the market or trim level. Inside the cabin, both cars had a similar dashboard layout, seating arrangement, and interior features, offering the same level of comfort and functionality for drivers and passengers alike.
        <br><br>
        Mechanically, the two models were offered with similar engine options, including 1.8-liter and 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engines, which provided reliable performance and decent fuel efficiency for their class. Because of these shared characteristics, the Mitsubishi Galant and Eterna delivered a very comparable driving experience, making them virtually interchangeable in many aspects, especially in markets where both were sold or rebadged.
